# t-configs

Personal dotfiles and system configuration. Clone once, run the install script, and you're set up.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tseitz/t-configs.git ~/t-configs
cd ~/t-configs
./install.sh
```

The install script is idempotent — safe to run multiple times. It will:

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (if not already installed)
2. Install all packages from the `Brewfile`
3. Install [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) with custom plugins and spaceship theme
4. Symlink dotfiles to their expected locations
5. Create a `.zshrc-env-vars` file from the example template

## Private Environment Variables

Secrets and API keys live in `dotfiles/.zshrc-env-vars`, which is **gitignored**.

On a fresh machine, the install script creates this file from the example template. Fill in your values:

```bash
nvim ~/t-configs/dotfiles/.zshrc-env-vars
```

See `dotfiles/.zshrc-env-vars.example` for the full list of supported variables.

## What's Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `dotfiles/.zshrc` | Zsh configuration — aliases, functions, PATH, tool init |
| `dotfiles/.zshenv` | Zsh environment — loads Cargo/Rust toolchain |
| `dotfiles/.zprofile` | Zsh profile — Homebrew shell environment |
| `dotfiles/.zshrc-env-vars.example` | Template for private environment variables |
| `dotfiles/.gitconfig` | Git configuration — user, LFS, default branch |
| `dotfiles/.hushlogin` | Suppresses macOS "Last login" terminal banner |
| `dotfiles/.config/nvim/` | Neovim configuration (LazyVim) |
| `dotfiles/.cursor/mcp.json` | Cursor MCP server configuration |
| `Brewfile` | Homebrew packages, casks, and dependencies |
| `install.sh` | Bootstrap script for new machines |

## Updating

After pulling changes, re-run the install script to pick up any new packages or symlinks:

```bash
cd ~/t-configs
git pull
./install.sh
```

## Adding a New Dotfile

1. Add the file to `dotfiles/`
2. Add a `create_symlink` line in `install.sh`:
   ```bash
   create_symlink "$DOTFILES_DIR/.your-config" "$HOME/.your-config"
   ```
3. Run `./install.sh` to create the symlink
